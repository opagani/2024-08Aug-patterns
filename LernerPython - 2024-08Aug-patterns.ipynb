It means that virtually everything we use in Python -- data, functions, classes -- is an object, which means that it follows the same rules as all other objects.  Once you learn the rules for objects in Python, you'll understand not only how your classes work, but also how other people's classes work, and how the builtin classes work, too.\n",
